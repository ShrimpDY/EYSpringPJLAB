    ```Shell
    # working on demo folder
    cd EYProjectLab/demo
    
    # Creating and activating virtual environment
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
  
    # Install dependencies

    cd frontend/projectlabdemp
    npm install
    ```

* On Windows:
  * Flask backend
    ```Shell
    # working on demo folder
    cd EYProjectLab\demo
      
    # Creating and activating virtual environment
    py -3 -m venv env
    .\env\Scripts\activate
      
    # Install dependencies
    py -3 -m pip install . --upgrade
    ```
  * Vue frontend
    ```Shell
    cd frontend\projectlabdemp
    npm install
    ```

## Running the app:
### 1. Running backend and frontend separately
 * Start the backend
   * On macOS and Linux:
     ```Shell
     # Working on demo folder
     cd EYProjectLab/demo
          
     # Reactivating virtual environment
     source env/bin/activate
          
     # Set flask environment variables
     export FLASK_APP=backend
     export FLASK_ENV=development
          
     # Run the backend server
     flask run
     ```
   * On Windows:
     ```Shell
     # Working on demo folder
     cd EYProjectLab\demo
      
     # Reactivating virtual environment
     .\env\Scripts\activate
      
     # Set flask environment variables
     set FLASK_APP=backend
     set FLASK_ENV=development
      
     # Run the backend server
     flask run
     ```
   
   In Flask, the default port is `5000`, and API url will be `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api_name`

## Future todo list:
Although our project lab has finished, there are still many areas need to be improved. The following list ia a series of potential improvement that can be made in the future.

- [ ] The stack bar's item shall be able to rearrange in a way that user wants.
- [ ] The system shall be able to display all the data view from graphs in one click.
- [ ] The graphs and data can be able to output to excel directly.
- [ ] We have captured several potential problems in our codes and we have documented them in the code TODO notation. Please review the todo list before implementing new features.
